		<h1>About Vue and Vuetify Todo List Project</h1>
		<p>
			This is my first ever Vue.js Project. I am coming from a background
			in React.js and I am attempting to learn the otherside of things. So
			far Vue has a lot of cool features and it is quite different from
			React.
		</p>
		<p>
			Practice makes perfect they say. I will continue to explore Vue and
			further this Todo App more. I am also utilizing Vuetify to style
			with ease. Thanks for checking out this little Application.
